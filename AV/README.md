### Notes:
- I tried different models(Logistic regression, AdaBoost, CatBoost, Xgboost, and LightGB) with hyperparamter optimization and without hyperparameters optimization. <br>
- LightGBM gave best CV score and best public score 
- [2842_5701.ipynp](https://github.com/dc-aichara/competitions/blob/master/AV/India_ML_Hiring_2019/2842_5701.ipynb) gave public score 0.2842 and private score 0.5701 which is highest among my submissions.<br>
- [3383_5674.ipynb](https://github.com/dc-aichara/competitions/blob/master/AV/India_ML_Hiring_2019/3383_5674.ipynb) gave public score 0.3383 and private score 0.5674 which is second highest among my submissions.<br>
- Notebooks don't include have EDA. <br>
- To learn Bayesioan Optimization technique for Hyperparameters Optimization read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/hyperparameters-optimization-for-lightgbm-catboost-and-xgboost-regressors-using-bayesian-6e7c495947a9). <br>

## [WNS Analytics Wizard 2019](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/wns-analytics-wizard-2019/)

### Notes: 
- I tried Catboost, LightGBM and XGBoost with hyperparameter optimization.
- Catboost gives better result for WNS data compare to LightGBM and XGBoost.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering explained in Notebooks.
- Ensemble (Catboost + LightGBM ) model scored 0.7532 on public data and 0.7455 on private data.
