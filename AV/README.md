### Note:
- I tried different models(Logistic regression, AdaBoost, CatBoost, Xgboost, and LightGB) with hyperparamter optimization and without hyperparameters optimization. <br>
- LightGBM gave best CV score and best public score 
- [2842_5701.ipynp]() gave public score 0.2842 and private score 0.5701 which is highest among my submissions.<br>
- [3383_5674.ipynb]() gave public score 0.3383 and private score 0.5674 which is second highest among my submissions.<br>
- Notebooks don't have EDA. <br>
- To learn Bayesioan Optimization technique for Hyperparameters Optimization read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/game-of-data/hyperparameters-optimization-for-lightgbm-catboost-and-xgboost-regressors-using-bayesian-6e7c495947a9). <br>
